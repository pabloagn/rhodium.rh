# What is Kedro?

- Framework
- Scalability
- Propper engineering foudnations for Data Science code.
- Production quality
- Tailored for ML models that require maintainability production-wise.
- Follows 12-Factor App software engineering philosophy.
- React or Django for ML.
- 8.1k Stars on GitHub
- Donated Kedro to the Linux Foundation
- Committee (Check for this) (Multi-stakeholder)

# Why Kedro?

- Address shortcomings of Jupyter when talking about production code.
- Encourage good software engineering practices.
-

# The Basics

![[Pasted image 20230504081518.png]]

- Data Catalog: Declarative configuration file to locate files.
  - Abstracted way to refer to datasets.
- Nodes & Pipelines: Based on CLI commands.
- Extensibility: Plugins, extensions.
- Supports orchestration platforms such as Airflow, and others.

# Creating a Kedro Project from Scratch

- Include `kedro~0.18.8` (Released 3 may 2023)
- `catalog.yml` -> Dataset specification

# Conclusions

## We've reviewed multiple yet simple mechanisms we can employ to make our code cleaner, more elegant, modular, usable, scalable and safer. These measures can not only help us become better programmers but better collaborators. It will make reading code a pleasure instead of an agonizing process and instantly boost our credibility.
