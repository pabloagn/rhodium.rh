# Contributing to Ghostty.org

Ghostty.org is the official Ghostty website.

**Note, Ghostty.org has different contributing guidelines than
the Ghostty project.** They are simpler. If you are familiar with
the Ghostty project contributing guidelines, you probably still
want to read the Quick Guide below.

## Quick Guide

**There is a typo or grammatical error in the website.**

Open a pull request with the correction. No need to make an
issue or discussion.

**There is a behavioral bug in the website.**

Open an issue with clear steps to reproduce the bug.

**There is a feature request for the website.**

[Open a discussion](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/discussions)
in the _Ghostty project_ repository. All feature requests even
for the website flow through the Ghostty discussions as a central
point.

New pages or new content constitutes a feature request.

Once the feature request is accepted, it will be converted to
an issue in this repository.

**Drive-by pull requests for features are discouraged.** If you
open a PR without previous discussion with a maintainer, you do
so at your own risk.
