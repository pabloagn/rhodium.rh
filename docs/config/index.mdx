  Ghostty supports hundreds of configuration options to make
  it look and behave exactly how you want.

## Zero Configuration Philosophy

Ghostty is designed to work out of the box with no configuration
for most users. Ghostty has sensible defaults, embeds a default
font (JetBrains Mono), has built-in nerd fonts, and more. We are
constantly challenging ourself as a project to eliminate any
_necessary configuration_ to use Ghostty.

To that end, if you find yourself needing to configure something
other than highly subjective things like the theme and you think
it should be a default, please
[open a discussion](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/discussions).

And, if you're used to feeling you need to configure your terminal,
maybe give Ghostty a try without any configuration first. You might
be surprised!

## Configuration Format

Ghostty is configured using a text-based configuration file.

<Note>
  In the future, we plan to also support native GUIs for
  configuration in line with our native UI philosophy. This will
  be in addition to the text-based configuration. Presently, the
  text-based configuration is the only way to configure Ghostty.
</Note>

### File Location

The configuration file, `config`, is loaded from these locations in the following order:

#### XDG configuration Path (all platforms):
- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ghostty/config`.
- if **XDG_CONFIG_HOME** is not defined, it defaults to `$HOME/.config/ghostty/config`.
#### macOS-specific Path (macOS only):
- `$HOME/Library/Application\ Support/com.mitchellh.ghostty/config`.
- macOS also supports the XDG configuration path mentioned above.

If both locations exist, they are loaded in the order above
with conflicting values in later files overriding earlier ones.
Configuration is optional and if no configuration file is found,
Ghostty will use its defaults.

### Syntax

Ghostty uses a custom, but very simplistic `key = value` syntax.
The syntax is documented below using comments in a sample configuration
file.

```ini
# The syntax is "key = value". The whitespace around the
# equals doesn't matter.
background = 282c34
foreground = ffffff

# Comments start with a `#` and are only valid on their own line.
# Blank lines are ignored!

keybind = ctrl+z=close_surface
keybind = ctrl+d=new_split:right

# Empty values reset the configuration to the default value
font-family =
```

Some other notes about the syntax:

- Keys are case-sensitive. `background` and `Background` are not
  the same. Ghostty always uses lowercase keys.

- Values can be quoted or unquoted. `font-family = "JetBrains Mono"`
  is the same as `font-family = JetBrains Mono`.

- Every configuration key is a valid CLI flag when launching
  Ghostty from the command-line. For example, the `background`
  key can be set with `ghostty --background=282c34`. Or the
  `font-family` key can be set with `ghostty --font-family="JetBrains Mono"`.

### Splitting into Multiple Files

You can split your configuration into multiple files by using
the `config-file` key in your configuration file. This key specifies
a path to another configuration file to load and can be specified
multiple times (cycles are detected and produce a warning).

Note that any `config-file` keys are processed at the _end_ of the
current file. This means that any keys after a `config-file` key
will not override the keys in the loaded file if they are set.

If the value is a relative path, it is relative to the configuration
file that contains the `config-file` key.

If the value is prefixed with `?`, the file is optional and if it
doesn't exist, it is ignored. This is particularly useful for
platform-specific or machine-specific configuration files.
(If for some cursed reason you have a file you want to load
that actually starts with `?`, you can escape by quoting
the entire value with double quotes.)

Example combining all of the above concepts:

```ini
config-file = some/relative/sub/config
config-file = ?optional/config
config-file = /absolute/path/config
```

## Reloading the Configuration

The configuration can be reloaded at runtime by pressing
`ctrl+shift+,` (Linux) or `cmd+shift+,` (macOS). These are
the default keybindings, but it is possible to define your
own via the `reload_config` action.

<Note>
Some configuration options cannot be reloaded at runtime;
others may only apply to newly created terminals. See the
specific configuration option for details.
</Note>

## Offline Reference Documentation

There are multiple places to find documentation on the configuration
options besides the website. All locations are identical (they're all
generated from the same source).

<Tip>
The online reference documentation
[is available here](/docs/config/reference).
</Tip>

1. There are HTML and Markdown formatted docs in the
   `$prefix/share/ghostty/docs` directory. This directory is created
   when you build or install Ghostty. The `$prefix` is `zig-out` if you're
   building from source (or the specified `--prefix` flag). On macOS,
   `$prefix` is the `Contents/Resources` subdirectory of the `.app` bundle.

2. There are man pages in the `$prefix/share/man` directory. This directory
   is created when you build or install Ghostty.

3. In the CLI, you can run `ghostty +show-config --default --docs`.
   Note that this will output the full default configuration with docs to
   stdout, so you may want to pipe that through a pager, an editor, etc.

4. In the source code, you can find the configuration structure in the
   [Config structure](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/main/src/config/Config.zig).
   The available keys are the keys verbatim, and their possible values are typically
   documented in the comments.

5. Not documentation per se, but you can search for the
   [public config files](https://github.com/search?q=path%3Aghostty%2Fconfig&type=code)
   of many Ghostty users for examples and inspiration.

<Note>
You may see strange looking blank configurations like `font-family =`. This
is a valid syntax to specify the default behavior (no value). The
`+show-config` outputs it so it's clear that key is defaulting and also
to have something to attach the doc comment to.
