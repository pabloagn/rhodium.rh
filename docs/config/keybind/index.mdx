title: Custom Keybindings
description: Associate a keypress with a specific action.
---

Ghostty supports flexible, custom keybindings through the
[`keybind` configuration option](/docs/config/reference#keybind).
The configuration reference has detailed reference documentation
for the option, but this page will give a high-level overview
of how to specify keybindings in Ghostty.

<Note>
The CLI command `list-keybinds` can be used to list all the available keybinds for Ghostty.
You can run this to see the default ones:
```sh
ghostty +list-keybinds --default
```
</Note>

The basic syntax of a keybinding configuration is:

```ini
keybind = trigger=action
```

## Trigger

The `trigger` part of a keybinding specifies the keypress events
that will trigger the action. The trigger can be a single key,
a single key with modifiers, or a sequence of keys.

A trigger has zero or more modifiers combined with one key.
For example, `a`, `ctrl+a`, `ctrl+shift+a`, `ctrl+alt+a` are
all valid triggers.

The set of possible keys is currently only available for
reference by [viewing the source code](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/d6e76858164d52cff460fedc61ddf2e560912d71/src/input/key.zig#L255).
This list is derived from Chromium's keycodes and is closely
associated with keys that have associated USB HID codes.

If a key is not in the list, **you can also specify a Unicode codepoint**.
If your key can decode into a single Unicode codepoint, Ghostty
will consider it a valid trigger and the trigger will activate
when a keypress event occurs which generates that codepoint. This
is particularly useful on non-US keyboard layouts.

For example, on a German keyboard you could bind "รถ" with the
configuration below. This would trigger when the "รถ" key is pressed
(";" on a US physical keyboard) because that key generates "รถ"
in Unicode.

```ini
keybind = ctrl+รถ=action
```

### Modifiers

Valid modifiers are:

- `shift`
- `ctrl` (alias: `control`)
- `alt` (alias: `opt`, `option`)
- `super` (alias: `cmd`, `command`)

<Note>
The fn or "globe" key on keyboards are not supported as a
modifier. This is a limitation of the operating systems and GUI toolkits
that Ghostty uses.
</Note>

### Trigger Prefixes

A trigger can also be prefixed with some special values
to change the behavior of the keybind. These are listed below.

Keybind triggers are not unique per prefix combination. For example,
`ctrl+a` and `global:ctrl+a` are not two separate keybinds. The keybind
set later will overwrite the keybind set earlier. In this case, the
`global:` keybind will be used.

Multiple prefixes can be specified. For example,
`global:unconsumed:ctrl+a=reload_config` will make the keybind global
in addition to not consuming the input to reload the config.

#### `all:`

Make the keybind apply to all terminal surfaces. By default,
keybinds only apply to the focused terminal surface. If this is true,
then the keybind will be sent to all terminal surfaces. This only
applies to actions that are surface-specific. For actions that
are already global (i.e. `quit`), this prefix has no effect.

#### `global:`

Make the keybind global. By default, keybinds only work
within Ghostty and under the right conditions (application focused,
sometimes terminal focused, etc.). If you want a keybind to work
globally across your system (i.e. even when Ghostty is not focused),
specify this prefix. This prefix implies `all:`. Note: this does not
work in all environments; see the additional notes below for more
information.

This feature is only supported on macOS. On macOS, this feature
requires accessibility permissions to be granted to Ghostty.
When a `global:` keybind is specified and Ghostty is launched or reloaded,
Ghostty will attempt to request these permissions. If the permissions are
not granted, the keybind will not work. On macOS, you can find these
permissions in System Preferences -> Privacy & Security -> Accessibility.

<Note>
The `global:` prefix is only available on macOS.
</Note>

#### `unconsumed:`

Do not consume the input. By default, a keybind
will consume the input, meaning that the associated encoding (if
any) will not be sent to the running program in the terminal. If
you wish to send the encoded value to the program, specify the
`unconsumed:` prefix before the entire keybind. For example:
`unconsumed:ctrl+a=reload_config`.

`global:` and `all:`-prefixed
keybinds will always consume the input regardless of this setting.
Since they are not associated with a specific terminal surface,
they're never encoded.

#### `performable:`

Only consume the input if the action is able to be performed. For example,
the `copy_to_clipboard` action will only consume the input if there is a
selection to copy. If there is no selection, Ghostty behaves as if the
keybind was not set. This has no effect with `global:` or `all:`-prefixed
keybinds. For key sequences, this will reset the sequence if the action is
not performable (acting identically to not having a keybind set at all).

Performable keybinds will not appear as menu shortcuts in the application
menu. This is because the menu shortcuts force the action to be performed
regardless of the state of the terminal. Performable keybinds will still
work, they just won't appear as a shortcut label in the menu.

Example:

```ini
keybind = performable:ctrl+c=copy_to_clipboard
```

## Action

Action is what happens when the trigger is activated. It is
in the format of `action` or `action:parameter` if the action
requires a parameter.

Here are some common actions that can be used in keybinds.
Please view the
[full list of actions](/docs/config/keybind/reference)
for a complete list. Ghostty supports dozens of actions.

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `ignore` | Do nothing, ignore the key input. This can be used to black hole certain inputs to have no effect and no encoding. |
| `unbind` | Remove the binding. This makes it so the previous action is removed, and the key will be sent through to the child command if it is printable. |
| `text:text` | Send a string. Uses Zig string literal syntax. i.e. `text:\x15` sends Ctrl-U. By using a prefix of `\x1b[` you can send control sequences but the convenience actions `csi:` and `esc:` are recommended instead. |
| `csi:text` | Send a CSI sequence. i.e. `csi:A` sends "cursor up". |
| `esc:text` | Send an escape sequence. i.e. `esc:d` deletes to the end of the word to the right. |
