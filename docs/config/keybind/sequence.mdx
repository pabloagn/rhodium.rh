title: Trigger Sequences
description: |-
  A trigger that requires a sequence of multiple keypress events.
---

Ghostty supports keybindings that require a sequence of triggers
to activate the action. For example, you could require `ctrl+a`
followed by `n` to open a new window. In other software, this is sometimes
referred to as a "leader key", a "key chord", a "key table",
etc.

To specify a sequence of triggers, use the
[normal trigger syntax](/docs/config/keybind#trigger) and
separate the triggers in the sequence with a `>` character.
An example is shown below:

```ini
keybind = ctrl+a>n=new_window
```

<Warning>
 If you define a sequence as a CLI argument to `ghostty`,
you probably have to quote the keybind since `>` is a special character
in most shells. Example: ghostty --keybind='ctrl+a>n=new_window'
</Warning>

A trigger sequence has some special handling:

  * Ghostty will wait an indefinite amount of time for the next key in
    the sequence. There is no way to specify a timeout. The only way to
    force the output of a prefix key is to assign another keybind to
    specifically output that key (i.e. `ctrl+a>ctrl+a=text:foo`) or
    press an unbound key which will send both keys to the program.

  * If a prefix in a sequence is previously bound, the sequence will
    override the previous binding. For example, if `ctrl+a` is bound to
    `new_window` and `ctrl+a>n` is bound to `new_tab`, pressing `ctrl+a`
    will do nothing.

  * Adding to the above, if a previously bound sequence prefix is
    used in a new, non-sequence binding, the entire previously bound
    sequence will be unbound. For example, if you bind `ctrl+a>n` and
    `ctrl+a>t`, and then bind `ctrl+a` directly, both `ctrl+a>n` and
    `ctrl+a>t` will become unbound.

  * Trigger sequences are not allowed for `global:` or `all:`-prefixed
    triggers. This is a limitation we could remove in the future.
