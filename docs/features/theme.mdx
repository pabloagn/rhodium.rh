## Built-in Themes

Ghostty ships with hundreds of built-in themes that can be selected
with one line of configuration by using the [`theme` configuration option](/docs/config/reference#theme). For example, to use the popular Catppucin theme:

```ini
theme = catppuccin-frappe
```

<Tip>
  Don't forget to [reload your configuration](/docs/config#reloading-the-configuration)
  after changing the theme.
</Tip>

The built-in themes are sourced from
[iterm2-color-schemes](https://iterm2colorschemes.com) and
updated in the Ghostty repository on the main branch weekly.
If you want to contribute a new theme, please contribute it to
iterm2-color-schemes and it will be automatically picked up by
Ghostty.

### Listing Available Themes

To see a list of available themes, you can use the `+list-themes` CLI:

```sh
ghostty +list-themes
```

For built-in themes, you can also view the theme list online
at [iterm2-color-schemes](https://iterm2colorschemes.com). This
also includes a preview of each theme.

## Separate Light and Dark Themes

Ghostty supports specifying separate light and dark themes.

```ini
theme = dark:catppuccin-frappe,light:catppuccin-latte
```

When separate light and dark themes are specified, Ghostty will
automatically switch between the light and dark theme based on
the system appearance.

## Authoring a Custom Theme

Themes are no different than any other configuration file
in Ghostty; they just happen to typically only set color options.
However, a theme file _could_ set any configuration option such
as cursor styles, fonts, etc.

<Warning>
  Themes can modify any configuration option, so be careful
  when using themes from untrusted sources. Always review the
  theme file before using it to ensure it doesn't contain
  malicious configuration.
</Warning>

The primary difference between a theme file and a regular
configuration file is how it is loaded. Themes are loaded
_first_ and any conflicting options in the user configuration
will override the theme (versus
[`config-file`](/docs/config/reference#config-file)
which is loaded _after_ the user configuration).

To author a custom theme, create a new file and set the
following options:

  - [`background`](/docs/config/reference#background)
  - [`foreground`](/docs/config/reference#foreground)
  - [`cursor-color`](/docs/config/reference#cursor-color)
  - [`selection-foreground`](/docs/config/reference#selection-foreground)
  - [`selection-background`](/docs/config/reference#selection-background)
  - [`palette`](/docs/config/reference#palette)

### File Location

Theme files can be located anywhere on the filesystem. The
[`theme`](/docs/config/reference#theme) configuration option allows
for absolute paths. However, if you want to reference a theme by
name, they have to be located in specific directories.

Theme lookup by name searches two directories:

  1. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ghostty/themes`
  2. `$PREFIX/share/ghostty/themes`

### Example

Below is an example of a complete theme file:

```ini
palette = 0=#51576d
palette = 1=#e78284
palette = 2=#a6d189
palette = 3=#e5c890
palette = 4=#8caaee
palette = 5=#f4b8e4
palette = 6=#81c8be
palette = 7=#a5adce
palette = 8=#626880
palette = 9=#e67172
palette = 10=#8ec772
palette = 11=#d9ba73
palette = 12=#7b9ef0
palette = 13=#f2a4db
palette = 14=#5abfb5
palette = 15=#b5bfe2
background = #303446
foreground = #c6d0f5
cursor-color = #f2d5cf
cursor-text = #c6d0f5
selection-background = #626880
selection-foreground = #c6d0f5
```
