If you're comfortable with running prerelease software, you can
help test the latest features and get the most recent bug fixes
by running prerelease builds of Ghostty. This helps the project
significantly by providing feedback on new features and addressing
possible issues before they are released to the public.

<Note>
During the private beta period of Ghostty, testers daily drove
prerelease builds using this same process. Many didn't have a single
issue for months or even over a year. The prerelease builds are
generally stable, but users should always be prepared for the
possibility of stability issues.
</Note>

An overview of how to install prerelease builds is provided below
with more details in the sections following the table.

| Platform | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| macOS | `auto-update-channel` to get the latest prerelease builds |
| Nix   | Standard `flake.nix` in the Ghostty repository |
| Linux | [Build from source](/docs/install/build) |

## macOS

For macOS, the Ghostty project provides signed and notarized builds
for the latest commit on the `main` branch. These are available
via [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/releases/tag/tip)
but also via the standard macOS auto-update mechanism.

If you are on a release build, you can switch to the prerelease channel
by setting [`auto-update-channel`](/docs/config/reference#auto-update-channel) to `tip`.

```ini
auto-update-channel = tip
```

<Tip>
Don't forget to restart Ghostty after changing the `auto-update-channel`
setting! This setting does not take effect until Ghostty is restarted.
</Tip>

<Warning>
While you can set this setting back to `stable` at any time, this will
only take effect when a later stable release is available. If you want
to downgrade back to the previous stable release, you must
[re-download](/download) Ghostty.
</Warning>

<Note>
**Why is this setting called "tip"?** The term "tip" is a common term
to refer to the latest commit on a branch in Git. Since we build
prerelease builds from the latest commit on the `main` branch, we
use the term "tip" to refer to the latest prerelease build rather than
something like "nightly".
</Note>

### Homebrew

You can also install prerelease builds using Homebrew using the
`@tip` version.

```shell-session
brew install --cask ghostty@tip
```

<Warning>
This is community-maintained. The `auto-update-channel` setting
is an official distribution channel.
</Warning>

## Nix

For Nix users on Linux, there is a standard
[`flake.nix` in the Ghostty repository](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/main/flake.nix).
Follow the same instructions as the
[Nix Flake](/docs/install/build#building-with-nix)
section on the building from source page.

<Note>
**The package in the flake only supports Linux.** Building macOS app
bundles is not well supported by Nix, so the package in the flake
only supports Linux. If you want to contribute a macOS package to
the flake, feel free to make a pull request!
