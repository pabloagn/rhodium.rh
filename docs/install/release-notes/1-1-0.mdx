description: |-
  Release notes for Ghostty 1.1.0, released on January 30, 2025.
---

Ghostty 1.1.0 features **1 month of work** with changes from
**84 contributors** over **564 commits.** The focus of this release
remains on critical bug fixes and quality of life improvements based
on feedback from the initial 1.0 release.

## Security

- [GHSA-98wc-794w-gjx3](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/security/advisories/GHSA-98wc-794w-gjx3).
  Fixed an issue where Ghostty would leak some file descriptors to the
  running shell or command.

## Highlights

### Server Side Decorations (SSD) on Linux

PR:
[#4630](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/4630),
[#4723](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/4723),
[#5124](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/5124)

On Linux in particular, window decorations have a wide variety of
styles and behaviors. Ghostty's previous behavior was to always use
client-side decorations (CSD), which made Ghostty look and feel too
much like a "GNOME" application. In particular, Ghostty looked out of
place on popular desktop environments like KDE Plasma.

Ghostty 1.1 on Linux now supports server-side decorations (SSD) for
compositors that support it. This allows Ghostty to look and feel more
like a native application on a wider variety of desktop environments.
This can be disabled if you prefer CSD or no decorations at all.

  </a>
</p>

(Left/Top: Old Client-Side Decorations, Right/Bottom: New Server-Side Decorations)

The `window-decoration` configuration option now has a new value `auto`
which will use SSD if the compositor supports it and prefers it. A value
of `server` will force SSD (if available). A value of `client` will force
client-side decorations. And a value of `none` will disable decorations
entirely.

SSD is only supported on Wayland. Ghostty uses the
[KDE Server Decoration](https://wayland.app/protocols/kde-server-decoration)
protocol. Despite the name, this protocol is supported on almost every
major Wayland compositor, not just KDE. For X11, we could not find a
well-supported protocol for SSD, so we continue to use CSD.

Future versions of Ghostty will continue to improve the native look and
feel across different desktop environments in Linux to the best of our
ability and protocol availability. For example, we're looking into native
menu bars, currently.

<Important>
Future versions of Ghostty will remove the `gtk-adwaita` option
and force a dependency on libadwaita. This is relevant to this change
because we found the vast majority of users who wanted SSD were using
`gtk-adwaita = false` to achieve this (which only worked in some cases).
With the new SSD support, this workaround is no longer necessary.
See [the dedication section](#gtk:-forcing-a-dependency-on-libadwaita) for more
details.

### Input Method Editor (IME) Improvements

PR:
[#3567](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/3567),
[#4332](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/4332),
[#4539](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/4539),
[#4854](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/4854),
[#4933](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/4933),
[#4999](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/4999)

For both macOS and Linux, we've tested IME with the following
paradigms: CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean), dead keys (such as
accented characters), emoji, Unicode hex input, and more and
have massively improved the reliability and consistency of IME
input.

On Linux, we've tested both `fcitx` and `ibus` under both X11 and
Wayland. We also tested multiple versions of each (in particular
versions that are common in LTS distributions). We found a bug in
ibus 1.5.29 that caused deadkey input to become "stuck" and worked
around it.

On macOS, we've ensured in particular that the AquaSKK and macSKK
Japanese language input methods work out of the box, although we've
also tested other IMEs and found them to work well as well.

### "Performable" Keybindings

PR:
[#4328](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/4328)

Keybinds support a new `performable:` prefix. This prefix indicates that
the keybind should only consume the input if the action is performed.

For example, the keybind below will only consume `ctrl+c` if there is
text able to be copied. Otherwise, `ctrl+c` will be passed to the shell
(typically causing an interrupt signal).

```
keybind = performable:ctrl+c=copy_to_clipboard
```

<Note>
Not all actions support `performable:`. Namely, many actions are always
performed (e.g. `text`, `new_tab`, etc.). The performable prefix only
applies to actions that have a meaningful "perform" state.
</Note>

### macOS: Alpha Blending Improvements

PR:
[#4913](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/4913),
[#5401](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/5401)

Alpha blending is the process of determining the result when a semi-transparent
foreground color is placed in front of a background color. This affects the
edges of text, and any images (displayed with Kitty Graphic Protocol) which
have transparency in them.

Before, this was performed by blending colors in the sRGB color space, which
causes darkening around the edges of text when the foreground and background
colors are different highly saturated colors. With Ghostty 1.1 on macOS, alpha
blending is now performed in the P3 color space by default, which reduces the
darkening issue thanks to the wider gamut and matches the appearance of native
macOS applications like Terminal.app and TextEdit.

Additionally, a configuration, `alpha-blending`, has been added to control this.
The default is `native`, which has been described, but two more options are
available:

- `linear` performs blending in a linear color space, which is technically
correct but has downsides like dark text seeming too thin and light text
seeming too thick.
- `linear-corrected` is like `linear` but applies a correction step to text
which makes it appear extremely close to `native`, but without _any_ darkening
problems.

Below you can compare (from left to right) the old blending, the new `native`
blending, `linear` blending, and `linear-corrected` blending. You may have to
zoom in to see the differences correctly.

  <img src="/images/1-1-0/p3_blending.png"  width="180" style={{maxWidth: "20%", marginInline: "5px"}} />
  <img src="/images/1-1-0/linear_blending.png" width="180" style={{maxWidth: "20%", marginInline: "5px"}} />
  <img src="/images/1-1-0/linear-corrected_blending.png" width="180" style={{maxWidth: "20%", marginInline: "5px"}} />
</p>

This is currently only available on macOS, but work is underway which should
bring it to Linux as well in the future.

### macOS: Quick Terminal Improvements

PR:
[#4049](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/4049),
[#4501](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/4501),
[#4999](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/4999),
[#5361](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/5361)

The quick terminal now works with native fullscreen windows,
space changes while the quick terminal is open, IME widgets, left/right
docks, and more.

A new configuration `quick-terminal-space-behavior` has been added to
control how the quick terminal reacts to changing macOS spaces while it
is open. The default behavior is to follow the active space (`move`).
You can also set it to `remain` to stay on the space it was opened on.

## Full List

[Full list of closed issues on GitHub](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/milestone/3?closed=1).

In each section, we try to sort improvements before bug fixes.

- Add the new `performable:` prefix to keybindings to only consume
  the input if the action is performed. See
  ["Performable" Keybindings](#%22performable%22-keybindings).
  [#4328](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/4328)

### Linux (GTK)

- GTK: Support for server-side decorations (SSD) has been added.
  This utilizes the existing `window-decoration` configuration option.
  The new value is `auto` which will use SSD if the compositor supports
  it and preferes it. A value of `server` will force SSD (if available).
  A value of `client` will force client-side decorations. And a value
  of `none` will disable decorations entirely.

  done instead of runtime, disabling behavior when we shouldn't have.
  [#4783](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/4783)
- GTK: `window-title-font-family` now works (previously this was macOS-only)
  [#4560](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/4560)
- GTK: Menu separator colors now match the system theme.
  [#4421](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/4421)

  crisp on GTK displays with fractional scaling.
  [#4255](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/4255)
- GTK: A new configuration `gtk-custom-css` allows loading custom CSS

- GTK: Use `gtk-xft-dpi` for font scaling on Wayland (previously
  we only used the value for X11). This allows the GNOME "Large Text"
  setting to work properly.

### Changes for Package Maintainers

<Note>
All of the build changes are minor and should not impact previously
functional builds. Feel free to ignore these changes unless you're
simply curious about them.
</Note>

- Build: `-Dstrip` can be used to control binary stripping. Previously,
  we automatically stripped release binaries. This can now be configured.
  [#3945](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/3945)
- Build: `-Dsentry` can be used to explicitly enable or disable Sentry.
  Linux builds by default have Sentry disabled. macOS builds by default
  have Sentry enabled. Sentry only collects crash logs locally, it does
  not transmit them via the network.
  [#3934](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/3934)
- Build: Terminfo/Termcap sources are no longer installed by default.
  Note the _compiled_ version is still properly installed so the terminfo
  is available. Build flags `-Demit-terminfo` and `-Demit-termcap` can be
  used to emit the source files.
  [#5311](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/5311)
- Build: Fix incorrect libadwaita pkg-config name.
  [#4818](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/4818)

## Roadmap

We plan to release a version 1.1.1 to address some additional bugs that
didn't quite make the 1.1.0 release. We don't expect this release to happen
quickly unless any critical issues or regressions are raised. Therefore,
we recommend all package managers to upgrade to 1.1.0 as quickly as possible.

The focus for the next release will be to continue to resolve some issues
with certain keyboard layouts along with some fundamental issues with
`window-step-resize` on macOS. Additional unplanned functionality may
be introduced if unexpected contributors appear (thank you!).

We're reaching general wide-scale stability since our initial 1.0 release.
I expect soon we'll move to even longer release cycles (months long) to
allow the development team to focus on larger, more impactful features.

### GTK: Forcing a Dependency on libadwaita

Starting with Ghostty 1.2, we plan to remove the `gtk-adwaita` option
and force a dependency on libadwaita. libadwaita is defaulted to on
already so unless you've explicitly disabled it, this change should
not affect you.

<Important>
**I expect for some this will be a controversial decision**,
so please read this section carefully to understand
our motivation and the diligence we've done in making this decision. If you
still have concerns, please reach out to us on GitHub or Discord.
</Important>

The primary use case for `gtk-adwaita = false` in earlier versions of Ghostty
was to use it in concert with `window-decoration = none` to force some
compositors to use server-side decorations (SSD). Note this didn't work
in all cases and was never an explicit configuration goal; it just happened
to work in some cases. With the introduction of
[explicit SSD support](#server-side-decorations-(ssd)-on-linux)
in Ghostty 1.1, _this workaround is no longer necessary_.

Another use case for `gtk-adwaita = false` was in relation to theming.
Ghostty 1.1 introduces a
[`gtk-custom-css` option](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/4200)
to easily inject custom CSS to theme GTK elements. We also introduced
more easily targetable class names across our GTK widgets. You could always
use system-wide CSS to theme Ghostty, but this new option makes it easier
to test and apply custom CSS specific to Ghostty.

For Ghostty maintainers, maintaining "classic GTK" and "libadwaita" code
paths is a significant burden, especially in addition to differences in
behavior across GTK and Adwaita versions and the complex interactions
of various Ghostty configurations (all the `gtk-` and `adw-` prefixed
options). This has led to a number of bugs and regressions that are
difficult to fix and test without expensive and complex CI setups.

With the SSD support in Ghostty 1.1 and the primary use case for
`gtk-adwaita = false` no longer necessary, we believe now is a good
time to make this change. We believe this will result in a more stable,
more maintainable, and more feature-rich Ghostty in the future (the last
point because we can go all-in on libadwaita features).

To better feel confident in this decision, we've also reached out directly
to non-GNOME users of Ghostty as well as non-Ghostty users who complained
about the look and feel of Ghostty (namely: bloggers, streamers, and
YouTubers). The feedback was unanimously supportive of this change,
understanding the reasoning and the benefits it would bring and acknowledging
that explicit SSD support addresses the major concerns.

If you have strong opinions on this change, please reach out to us
on Discord or GitHub. Please justify your argument with specific use cases
and scenarios where this change would negatively impact you. Please do not
just say "I don't like it" without providing a reason; it's not helpful.
We are open to feedback and will consider it carefully. Thank you!
