  Release notes for Ghostty 1.1.1, released on February 13, 2025.
---

Ghostty 1.1.1 features **two weeks of work** with changes from
**13 contributors** over **125 commits.** The focus of this release
is on fixing regressions or bugs introduced as part of the 1.1.0
release. We've also snuck in some nice improvements to existing
features.

<Important>
A critical regression was found in Ghostty 1.1.1 on macOS that caused
control-modified keys to not work properly in programs using the Kitty
Keyboard protocol such as Neovim and Fish 4.0. This was fixed in
[1.1.2](/docs/install/release-notes/1-1-2).

## Highlights

### Server Side Decorations (SSD) on Linux X11

PR:
[#5533](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/5533)

Ghostty 1.1.0 introduced support for
[server-side decorations (SSD) on Linux for Wayland compositors](/docs/install/release-notes/1-1-0#server-side-decorations-(ssd)-on-linux).
This allows Ghostty to look and feel
more like a native application on a wider variety of desktop environments.
Notably, however, this did not work on X11.

With Ghostty 1.1.1, we've added support for SSD on X11 as well when
`window-decoration = server`. X11 doesn't provide a standard way to
tell us if it prefers SSD or client-side decorations (CSD), so SSD on
X11 only works with the explicit `server` configuration and does not work
with the `auto` value.

### Continued Input Method Editor (IME) Improvements

PR:
[#5550](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/5550)
[#5448](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/5448)

A lot of effort went into Ghostty 1.1.0 to improve IME support, but
ironically broke the scenario where no input method was active (the
GTK "simple" input method). This has been fixed in 1.1.1.
A workaround in 1.1.0 was to install `ibus` or `fcitx`. This is no
longer necessary, and the "simple" input method should work as expected.

Additionally, on macOS, improved IME support regressed the ability for
certain keyboard layouts to input control characters (e.g. `ctrl+c`).
This has been fixed in 1.1.1.

### macOS: Renderer Improvements for Intel GPUs

PR:
[#5625](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/5625),
[#5652](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/5652)

It turns out Ghostty was triggering undefined behavior on macOS
when using discrete GPUs. Practically, this only affected Intel Macs because
all Apple Silicon Macs have integrated GPUs and Ghostty will always prefer
an integrated GPU if available for power efficiency.

The undefined behavior would sometimes work but sometimes result in rendering
artifacts or other strange visual behaviors. We now properly detect
discrete GPUs and use the proper APIs and behaviors to avoid undefined
behavior.

  on startup, following the behavior of other native macOS applications.

- macOS: Close confirmation now appears if there is an active but
  hidden quick terminal that requires close confirmation.

### Changes for Package Maintainers

- A new Zig dependency [`zig-gobject`](https://github.com/ianprime0509/zig-gobject)
  was introduced. This is licensed 0BSD. The introduction of this dependency
  does not change the existing process for packaging Ghostty.

## Roadmap

At the time of this release, we do not plan to have followup patch releases.
We believe the remaining bugs are minor and can be addressed as part of
a future, larger 1.2.0 release. We will continue to monitor the issue
tracker and pull requests for any critical issues that may arise.

The focus will shift to the 1.2.0 release. This will be a larger release
with more significant changes and features. The timeline for this release
is not yet determined, but is likely to be several months away.

One major breaking change planned with 1.2.0 for Linux is to require
`libadwaita`. We announced this intention as part of the 1.1.0 release
and have asked for feedback if this is an issue. Before providing feedback,
please
[carefully read the details about this change](/docs/install/release-notes/1-1-0#gtk:-forcing-a-dependency-on-libadwaita).
