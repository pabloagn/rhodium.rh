  Release notes for Ghostty 1.0.1, released on December 31, 2024.

## Security

- [GHSA-5hcq-3j4q-4v6p](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/security/advisories/GHSA-5hcq-3j4q-4v6p).
  Fixed a security vulnerability where Ghostty was improperly handling
  window title sequences in such a way that could lead to arbitrary code
  execution (required user interaction).

- [GHSA-hfg5-8q2c-crhc](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/security/advisories/GHSA-hfg5-8q2c-crhc).
  The file created with `write_*_file` keybind actions previously defaulted to
  mode `0644` allowing any local user to read the file. The file now defaults
  to mode `0600` to prevent unauthorized access.

## Highlights

### Default Configuration File

PR: [#3460](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/3460)

Ghostty will now create a default configuration file on launch if no
non-empty configuration files are found. In line with our
[zero configuration philosophy](/docs/config#zero-configuration-philosophy),
the default configuration file only has comments, but the comments help
educate users on file location, syntax, and documentation.

For the 1.0.0 release, we noticed there was a significant amount of confusion
about where the configuration file was located, how to edit it, and what
options were available. This change is intended to help users better
understand how to configure Ghostty.

### Bitmap Font Support

PR: [#4115](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/4115) (CoreText),
[#3837](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/3837) (Freetype)

Ghostty now supports bitmap fonts on both macOS and Linux. Bitmap fonts
must still be in truetype format, but may contain bitmaps for each glyph
instead of outlines.

### macOS: "Settings" Improvements

PR: [#4004](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/4004)

The "Settings" menu option (`open_config` keybinding action) has
improved in several ways.

First, Ghostty now finds the first non-empty configuration file to open
if one exists. Previously, Ghostty would always open the XDG configuration
path first, even if the AppSupport path existed. This led to confusion because
the AppSupport path overrides the XDG path. Now, Ghostty will open the
AppSupport path if it exists, and if not, it will open the XDG path.

Second, Ghostty now properly prioritizes opening the AppSupport path over
the XDG path if neither path exists. This is important because the AppSupport
path overrides all other paths on macOS.

Third, Ghostty now uses the `-t` flag with `open` to open the configuration
file in a text editor.

<Note>
A future update will allow users to use their `$EDITOR` to open the
configuration file. And another future update will allow users to use
a GUI to modify the configuration file.
</Note>

## Bug Fixes

[Full list of closed issues on GitHub](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/milestone/2?closed=1).

- keybinds with triggers that map to a key are now treated as a translated
  key and not a unicode trigger, i.e. `cmd+1` now works in addition to
  `cmd+one` and `cmd+.` is the same as `cmd+period`.
  [#4147](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/4147)
- `write_selection_file` would sometimes write empty contents.

## Changes for Package Maintainers

- The Ghostty source tarball is now named `ghostty-${VERSION}.tar.gz`
  (from `ghostty-source.tar.gz`) and extracts to a directory named
  `ghostty-${VERSION}` (from `ghostty-source`). This better aligns with
  standard source tarball conventions. The `PACKAGING.md` file has been
  updated to reflect this change.
  [#3490](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/3490)
- `DESTDIR` now works properly as documented in `PACKAGING.md`.
  [#3426](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/3426)

## Known Issues

Ghostty 1.0.1 still contains many known issues, but is considered stable
for general, professional use.

We are working hard to triage and resolve these issues. This release addresses
what we felt were the most critical issues, especially given many people are
about to return from holiday and get back to work.
Please see the GitHub discussions and issue tracker for more information
on known or newly discovered issues.

## Roadmap

We plan to release a version 1.0.2 in the near future. We don't want to
get in the habit of releasing too many patch versions, but there are still
a number of important issues discovered from our initial public release that
we feel are important to resolve as quickly as possible.

The major categories of issues we are looking into for 1.0.2 are keyboard
input issues especially with non-US keyboard layouts, xterm compatibility
issues, and GUI issues on both Linux and macOS.

Long term, we plan to follow a general pattern of only releasing one or
two patch versions after a significant release, followed by a months-long
period of development towards the next significant release[^1]. This pattern
will allow package maintainers to keep up with our releases and get them into
distribution channels without too much churn, and allow maintainers to focus
on new features and improvements.

      immediate attention.
