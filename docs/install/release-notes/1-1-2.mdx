Ghostty 1.1.2 is a hotfix to fix a critical regression from 1.1.1
on macOS that caused control-modified keys to not work properly
in programs using Kitty Keyboard protocol such as Neovim and Fish 4.0.

This was released on the same day as 1.1.1, please see the
[1.1.1 release notes](/docs/install/release-notes/1-1-1).

<Note>
**There are no changes in this release for Linux.** Package managers
can skip this release and stay on 1.1.1 until the next release if that
is more convenient.
