  Release notes for Ghostty 1.1.3, released on March 24, 2025.
---

Ghostty 1.1.3 primarily addresses Gnome 48 and GTK 4.18 compatibility issues
but also includes bug fixes for all platforms. This release contains no
features or improvements and is only focused on stability and
compatibility. The next major release (1.2.0) will include new features
and improvements. This release includes changes from **11 contributors**
over **21 commits.**

## Highlights

### Gnome 48, GTK 4.18 Compatibility

PR:
[#6877](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6877)

Ghostty 1.1.3 is fully compatible with Gnome 48 and GTK 4.18.

GTK 4.18 changes the default renderer for GTK applications to the
["ngl" renderer](https://blog.gtk.org/2024/01/28/new-renderers-for-gtk/).
This change exposed some bugs in Ghostty's rendering code that caused
major visual glitches that effectively made Ghostty unusable on GTK 4.18
with prior versions (1.1.2 and earlier).

Since Ghostty now works with all current GTK GSK renderers, the
`gtk-gsk-renderer` configuration is deprecated and no longer has any effect.
If users want to force a specific GTK renderer, they can use the
standard GTK
[`GSK_RENDERER` environment variable](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/running.html#gsk_renderer).
The configuration option still exists but will be removed in Ghostty
1.2.0.

## Full List

[Full list of closed issues on GitHub](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/milestone/6?closed=1).

- OSC 21 (Kitty color protocol): Ghostty no longer sends a response for
  non-query requests.
  [#5770](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/5770)
- The pty no longer has an initialize size of `0x0`. The size is something
  non-zero but may still be incorrect due to a race condition between
  initializing the pty and drawing the GUI window. We do not consider
  this a bug.
  [#5776](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/5776)
- Increase the maximum number of parameters for CSI sequences to 24.
  This fixes some SGR sequences that were not working properly in
  Kakoune.
  [#5949](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/5949)
- The default binding for `equalize_splits` is now usable by default
  for US (and similar) keyboard layouts. It was previously an impossible
  binding. The binding is `super+ctrl+shift+plus`.
  [#5646](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/5646)
- The elvish shell integration `sudo` feature now works properly.
  [#5992](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/5992)

### macOS

- macOS: The new tab button is now more visible with semi-transparent
  dark backgrounds.
  [#5897](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/5897)
- macOS: New windows created while the quick terminal is in focused
  now properly transfer focus to the new window.
  [#5834](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/5834)
- macOS: Fix an issue where the terminal draw area would appear
  garbled until focused under various conditions, most reliably when
  a DPI change occurred.
  [#6008](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6008)
- macOS: Fix an issue where the terminal inspector menu item would
  become deactivated under certain conditions in the Quick Terminal.
  [#6024](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6024)
- macOS: The equalize splits keybind and menu item now only affect
  the focused tab, as expected.
  [#6080](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6080)

### Linux (GTK)

- GTK: Fix various rendering issues with the "ngl" GSK renderer.
  This resolves compatibility issues with GTK 4.18 and Gnome 48.
  [#6877](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6877)
- GTK: Treat negative content scale values from GTK as 1.0.
  This fixes some known default setting issues on Gentoo systems.
  [#5954](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/5954)
- GTK: Make the split drag handle area smaller to allow selecting
  text on the boundary. This fix isn't perfect but is an improvement.
  A more comprehensive fix is planned for 1.2.0.
  [#6000](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6000)
- GTK: The `title` configuration is now respected when a new tab
  is created from the tab overview.
  [#6032](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6032)
- GTK: Improve the reliability of Korean input methods, specifically
  the `fcitx5-hangul` input method.
  [#6779](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/6779)

### Changes for Package Maintainers

- The `fetch-zig-cache.sh` script is back in the source tarball.
  This was erroneously removed in 1.1.1 and 1.1.2.
  [#5762](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/5762)
- A new `build.zig.zon.txt` file is included in the source tarball.
  This is an easily parsable file that contains the URL of every
  dependency used to build Ghostty (for all configurations, so this
  includes optional dependencies).
  [#5764](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/5764)

This release still requires Zig 0.13, but note that the next major
release (1.2.0) will require Zig 0.14. This is just a heads-up for
package maintainers. The main branch of Ghostty is already updated
to Zig 0.14 so you can start testing now, if you wish. There is no
schedule for the 1.2.0 release yet, we expect it to still be months
away.

Any future patch releases for 1.1.x will continue to require Zig 0.13.

## Roadmap

The focus of our efforts remain on the 1.2.0 release, which is shaping
up very nicely. We didn't expect to have a 1.1.3 release, but the
compatibility issues with GTK 4.18 and Gnome 48 were severe enough
that we felt it was necessary to release a patch.

I don't want to make any promises for any specific features coming in
1.2.0, but we are working hard to address many of the most requested
features and improvements.

Ghostty 1.1.x has been a very stable series, and we are in no rush to
ship 1.2.0, so there is no timeline for that release yet. We will
cut the release when we feel it is ready. Thank you!
