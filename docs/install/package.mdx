  For people who want to build and package Ghostty for their platform.

<Warning>
**This page is for people who want to build and package Ghostty for
others.** If you want to just use Ghostty, you should follow the
[installation instructions](/download).
</Warning>

Ghostty relies on downstream package maintainers to distribute
Ghostty to end-users. If you're interested in packaging Ghostty for
your platform, _thank you very much_.

We've put together a
[packaging guide](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/main/PACKAGING.md)
within the Ghostty source tree. This is the most up to date
information on how to package Ghostty. Please refer to that guide.

If you have any questions or need help, we're very happy to help.
Please open an issue directly on the Ghostty repository.
