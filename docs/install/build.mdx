title: Build Ghostty from Source
description: |-
  Build Ghostty yourself from source code. This is only recommended for
  people who don't have access to binaries or packages, or for developers
  who want to contribute to Ghostty.
---

<Tip>
**Building Ghostty from source is not recommended for most users.**
If you have access to a prebuilt binary or package, you should use that
instead. See [the binaries and packages page](/docs/install/binary) to
see if a prebuilt binary or package is available for your platform.
</Tip>

To build Ghostty, you need [Zig 0.14](https://ziglang.org/) installed.

<Important>
**Zig 0.14 is required.** Ghostty only guarantees that it can build
against 0.14. Zig is still a fast-moving project so it is likely newer
versions will not be able to build Ghostty yet. You can find binary
releases of Zig release builds on the
[Zig downloads page](https://ziglang.org/download/).
</Important>

The official build environment is defined by [Nix](https://nixos.org/).
You do not need to use Nix to build Ghostty, but the Nix environment is the
environment which runs CI tests and builds release artifacts, so it is the most
reliable way to build Ghostty. See the [Building with Nix](#building-with-nix)
section to see how to set up the Nix environment.

On Linux, you may need to install additional dependencies. See
[Linux Installation Tips](#linux-installation-tips). On macOS, you
need Xcode installed with both the macOS and iOS SDKs enabled. See
[Mac `.app`](#mac-.app).

Begin by cloning the Ghostty repository and changing into the directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty
cd ghostty
```

To build a stable release, check out the associated tag. If you skip this
step you'll build the [tip version](/docs/install/pre).

<Important>
**Version 1.1.3 and under requires Zig version 0.13 to build**. When building
from tip you will however need Zig version 0.14 due to build system changes and
other updates to the tooling used.
</Important>

```
git checkout <tag>
```

With Zig and necessary dependencies installed, a binary can then be built
using `zig build`:

```sh
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
```

On Linux, this will build a ready-to-use binary at `zig-out/bin/ghostty`.
On macOS, this will build the Xcode framework but additional steps are
required to build the `.app` bundle. See [Mac `.app`](#mac-.app).

<Tip>
For Linux users: To install system-wide or on your user account, see
[Installation Directory](#installation-directory).
</Tip>

<Tip>
For a debug build, omit the `-Doptimize=ReleaseFast` flag. Debug builds
are **extremely slow** (over 100x slower) than release builds, so only
use them for development.
</Tip>

## Linux Installation Tips

### Dependencies

On Linux, you'll need to install header packages for Ghostty's dependencies
before building it. Only a few dependencies are needed for source builds
because Ghostty will build everything else statically by default.

Required dependencies:

  * `gtk4`
  * `libadwaita` (unless using `-Dgtk-adwaita=false`)
  * `blueprint-compiler`
  * `pkg-config`
  * `gettext`

<Warning>
GTK 4.14 on Wayland has a bug which may cause an immediate crash.
There is an
[open issue](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/issues/6589)
to track this GTK bug. You can workaround this issue by running ghostty with
`GDK_DEBUG=gl-disable-gles ghostty`.
</Warning>

#### Alpine

```sh
doas apk add gtk4.0-dev libadwaita-dev pkgconf ncurses blueprint-compiler gettext
```

#### Arch Linux

```sh
sudo pacman -S gtk4 gtk4-layer-shell libadwaita blueprint-compiler gettext
```

#### Debian and Ubuntu

```sh
sudo apt install libgtk-4-dev libadwaita-1-dev git blueprint-compiler gettext libxml2-utils
```

On Debian unstable/testing, the `gcc-multilib` package is also required
for building.

<Note>
**A recent GTK is required for Ghostty to work with Nvidia (GL) drivers
under x11.** Ubuntu 22.04 LTS has GTK 4.6 which is not new enough. Ubuntu 23.10
has GTK 4.12 and works. From [this discussion](https://discourse.gnome.org/t/opengl-context-version-not-respected-on-gtk4-rs/12162?u=cdehais)
the problem was fixed in GTK by Dec 2022. Also, if you are a BTRFS user, make
sure to manually upgrade your Kernel (6.6.6 will work). The stock kernel in
Ubuntu 23.10 is 6.5.0 which has a bug which
[causes zig to fail its hash check for packages](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/17282).
</Note>

#### Fedora

On Fedora variants, use

```sh
sudo dnf install gtk4-devel gtk4-layer-shell-devel zig libadwaita-devel blueprint-compiler gettext
```

On Fedora Atomic variants, use

```sh
rpm-ostree install gtk4-devel gtk4-layer-shell-devel zig libadwaita-devel blueprint-compiler gettext
```

#### Gentoo

```sh
emerge -av libadwaita gtk blueprint-compiler gettext
```

#### openSUSE Tumbleweed

```sh
sudo zypper install gtk4-devel libadwaita-devel pkgconf ncurses-devel zig blueprint-compiler gettext
```

#### openSUSE Leap

```sh
sudo zypper install gtk4-devel libadwaita-devel pkgconf ncurses-devel blueprint-compiler gettext
```

#### Solus

```sh
sudo eopkg install libgtk-4-devel libadwaita-devel pkgconf zig blueprint-compiler gettext
```

#### Void

```sh
sudo xbps-install gtk4-devel libadwaita-devel pkg-config zig blueprint-compiler gettext
```

### Broken Dependencies

#### Pango

If you are experiencing a segfault in `cairo_scaled_font_get_font_options`
when running Ghostty, your Pango version may have a bug. See
[this discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/discussions/3258#)
for more information on how to resolve this.

### Installation Directory

Use `zig build` with the `-p` (prefix) flag to install Ghostty into
a target directory. This will setup the proper FHS directory structure
that ensures features such as shell integration, icons, GTK shortcuts, etc.
all work.

For local, unprivileged installs, we recommend `$HOME/.local`:

```
zig build -p $HOME/.local -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
...
```

With a typical Freedesktop-compatible desktop environment (i.e. Gnome,
KDE), this will make Ghostty available as an app in your app launcher.
If you don't see it immediately you may have to log out and log back
in or maybe even restart.

If Ghostty fails to launch using an app icon in your app launcher,
ensure that `~/.local/bin` is on your _system_ `PATH`. The desktop environment
itself must have that path in the `PATH`. Google for your specific desktop
environment and distribution to learn how to do that.

For system-wide installs, we recommend `/usr` (likely requires `sudo`):

```shell-session
zig build -p /usr -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
```

### Building with Nix

The Nix build environment can be accessed like any other
[Nix dev shell](https://nix.dev/tutorials/first-steps/declarative-shell.html),
via the `nix develop` command (or `nix-shell` if you don't have the
[`nix-command` experimental feature](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.24/development/experimental-features#xp-feature-nix-command)
enabled).

If you use [`nix-direnv`](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv),
Ghostty provides an `.envrc` file you can source by running `direnv allow`.
This will allow you to seamlessly enter and exit the Ghostty development
environment as you enter and exit the Ghostty repository. Direnv is not
required.

After setting up the Nix environment, you can run the same `zig build`
as on other distributions or you can also build the package with Nix
by running:

```sh
nix build .#ghostty
```

The binary would then be located under `./result/bin/ghostty`.

Building with Nix should yield the same result as building it with Zig,
but with higher reproducibility guarantees that ensure every part of
Ghostty can be built reliably.

## Mac `.app`

To build the macOS application, you must build on a macOS machine with
Xcode installed and the active developer directory pointing to it. If
you're not sure that's the case, check the output of `xcode-select
--print-path`:

```sh
xcode-select --print-path
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools        # <-- BAD

sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
xcode-select --print-path
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer # <-- GOOD
```

The above can happen if you install the Xcode Command Line Tools _after_ Xcode
is installed.

Next, make sure you have both the macOS and iOS SDKs installed (from
inside Xcode → Settings → Components). Finally, build Ghostty and the
app:

```sh
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
cd macos && xcodebuild
```

<Note>
If you're using the Nix environment on macOS, `xcodebuild` will
fail due to the linker environment variables Nix sets. You must
run the `xcodebuild` command specifically outside of the Nix
environment.
</Note>

This will output the app to `macos/build/ReleaseLocal/Ghostty.app`.

The "ReleaseLocal" build configuration is specifically for local release
builds and disables some security features (such as "Library Validation")
to make it easier to run without having to have a code signing identity
and so on. These builds aren't meant for distribution. If you want a release
build with all security features,
[use the official binary build](/download).
