  How to seek help, a list of common issues and solutions,
  and how to report a bug or request a feature.

Ghostty is a personal side project with no commercial backing.
As such, there is no support team or dedicated resources to help you.
The community is very helpful and may provide assistance, and
we try to document as many common issues and solutions as possible.

## Common Issues and Solutions

|-------|----------|
| Error "missing or unsuitable terminal" when running commands or using SSH. | [Terminfo](/docs/help/terminfo) |
| macOS window managers such as Yabai or Aerospace act strange | [macOS Tiling Window Managers](/docs/help/macos-tiling-wms) |
| Ghostty has slow startup or high memory usage on Linux. | [GTK Single Instance](/docs/help/gtk-single-instance) |
| macOS defaults to login shells | [macOS Login Shells](/docs/help/macos-login-shells)

## Reporting Bugs or Requesting Features

Please, please, please read the [contributing guide on GitHub](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

<Important>
**GitHub Issues is probably not the right place to go.** This project
starts all bugs and feature requests as discussions on GitHub Discussions
until more specific details are known. From there, we convert them into
GitHub Issues as needed. See the contributing guide for more details.
