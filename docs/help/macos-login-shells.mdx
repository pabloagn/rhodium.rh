title: macOS Login Shells
description: |-
  In other Unix systems terminal emulators are generally started
  using non-login shells. Due to various reasons, macOS defaults
  all terminals as login shells.

Ghostty respects the macOS traditions and will start each shell as a login
shell. This matches the behavior of other terminal emulators on macOS, most
notably the default Terminal.app. However, this behavior is different from
other Unix systems, and may cause confusion for users who are used to the
behavior of those systems.

## Why Login Shells

Traditionally, unix shells have two main files that expect to be run before the user
is able to interact with the shell: a profile file and the rc file. The
profile file is usually run once at login and is used to set up the environment
for the user. The rc file is run every time a new shell is created and is used
to set up the shell itself.

Using zsh as an example (the default shell on macOS since 10.15):
zsh uses the `.zprofile` and `.zshrc` files. On most Linux systems `.zprofile`
(or similar) is executed when the user initially logs in via something like
a desktop manager. This allows subsequent shells to inherit the environment
and any setup done by `.zprofile`. The idea here is that any expensive
initialization only needs done once at login, and subsequent shells can reuse
everything from the setup process.

<Note>
Zsh is used as an example but almost any shell can be used in its place and
have the same behavior, with the exception of bash. Bash will **only** read
`.bashrc` if the shell is both interactive and non-login. Since macOS moved from
tcsh to bash in OSX 10.2 Jaguar, this difference in bash may have been
overlooked, resulting in developers placing their shell setup entirely in
`.profile` as `.bashrc` would rarely be run, specifically not by starting a new
terminal. Now that zsh is the new default, `.zprofile` and `.zshrc` are both
called starting an interactive non-login shell.
</Note>

macOS differs in that the GUI used to login to the system does not run
`.zprofile` as it has its own method of loading in system level global
settings. This means that any terminal emulator must run shells as login or
else new shells would be potentially broken since they would be missing any
setup process in `.zprofile`. This is the unfortunate reality, but makes sense
in that there is no `.xsession` or similar, since `.zprofile` is never run,
that can give a users terminals access to initial settings or set things like
global environment variables [^1].

This however does *not* mean that everything should just go in `.zprofile`, or
that the two files are always called together. Since zsh is started in login
mode and interactive mode, both `.zprofile` and `.zshrc` will run every time
a new terminal is created. However, if you run a shell inside of a terminal
emulator that will only be an interactive shell and it will lose access to the
parent shells settings that were initialized in `.zprofile`. You can test this
by placing an alias in your `.zprofile` and starting a terminal instance and
running that alias, then run `zsh` and you will find that the alias is no longer
available.

Therefore, most shell setup should still go in the `.zshrc` file so that any shells,
terminal or otherwise, are initialized correctly. This is also somewhat in line
with how dotfiles on other Linux systems would be written.
