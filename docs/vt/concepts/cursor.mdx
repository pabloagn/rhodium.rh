title: Cursor
description: |-
  The cursor is the row and column where the next
  character will be printed or location-sensitive control
  sequence will be executed.
---

The cursor is always present in a terminal and is located at
some row and column within the active screen area. The cursor
may be visually hidden, but the terminal internal state always
has a cursor, and it is always located at some active position.

The cursor most commonly is associated with where the next
printed character will be placed. However, the cursor is also
used for location-sensitive control sequences. For example,
when an [erase line control sequence](/docs/vt/csi/el) is
executed, the cursor determines the first line to erase.

The terminal has a single cursor [per screen](/docs/vt/concepts/screen).
**Note that this document is about the cursor as it relates
to the [terminal API](/docs/vt).** Applications such as editors may
have their own concept known as a "cursor" that is completely
unrelated to the terminal cursor. For example, an editor may support
"multiple cursors", but the underlying terminal API is both a separate
concept and only supports a single cursor at any given moment.

## Initial State

The cursor is always initially located at the top-left corner of the screen.

## Pending Wrap State

The pending wrap state is a boolean value that is set when a character
is printed in the rightmost column of the screen to indicate that the
next printed character should wrap to the next line.

If the pending wrap state is set, the next printed character will
move the cursor to the leftmost column of the next line, unset
the pending wrap state, and then print the character[^1].

The pending wrap state may feel like an obvious and inconsequential
feature, but it has a significant (but subtle) impact on cursor
behavior. For example, print followed by [backspace](/docs/vt/control/bs)
behaves differently depending on if you're printing in the rightmost
column of the screen or not.

If you print a character in any column other than the rightmost column
and then send a [backspace](/docs/vt/control/bs) control character, the
cursor will move back on top of the most recently printed character.
But if you print a character in the rightmost column and then send a
[backspace](/docs/vt/control/bs) control character, the cursor will move
to the left of the character most recently printed. This is the
source of [bugs in multiple popular shell prompts](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/884).

You will see that many control sequences note that they
"unset the pending wrap state". This is just as it sounds: if the
pending wrap state is set on the cursor, it becomes unset. The next
printed character will not wrap to the next line.

[^1]: This isn't strictly true. Wraparound modes and scroll regions
can change this behavior.
