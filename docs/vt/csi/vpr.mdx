title: Vertical Position Relative (VPR)
description: |-
  Move the cursor to a specific row relative to the current position.

<VTSequence sequence={["CSI", "Py", "e"]} />

This sequence performs [cursor position (CUP)](/docs/vt/csi/cup) with `y` set
to the current cursor row plus `y` and `x` set to the current cursor column.
There is no additional or different behavior for using `VPR`.

The parameter `y` must be an integer greater than or equal to 1. If `y` is less than
or equal to 0, adjust `y` to be 1. If `y` is omitted, `y` defaults to 1.

Because this invokes `CUP`, the cursor column (`x`) can change if it is
outside the bounds of the `CUP` operation. For example, if
[origin mode](#TODO) is set and the current cursor position is outside
of the scroll region, the column will be adjusted.
