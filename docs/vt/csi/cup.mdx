title: Cursor Position (CUP)
description: Move the cursor to row `y` and column `x`.
---

<VTSequence sequence={["CSI", "Py", ";", "Px", "H"]} />

The parameters `y` and `x` must be integers greater than or equal to 1.
If either is less than or equal to 0, adjust that parameter to be 1.

The values `y` and `x` are both one-based. For example, the top row is row 1
and the leftmost column on the screen is column 1.

This sequence always unsets the pending wrap state.

If [origin mode](#TODO) is **NOT** set, the cursor is moved exactly to the
row and column specified by `y` and `x`. The maximum value for `y` is the
bottom row of the screen and the maximum value for `x` is the rightmost
column of the screen.

If [origin mode](#TODO) is set, the cursor position is set relative
to the top-left corner of the scroll region. `y = 1` corresponds to
the [top margin](#TODO) and `x = 1` corresponds to the [left margin](#TODO).
The maximum value for `y` is the [bottom margin](#TODO) and the maximum
value for `x` is the [right margin](#TODO).

When origin mode is set, it is impossible set a cursor position using
this sequence outside the boundaries of the scroll region.

## Validation

### CUP V-1: Normal Usage

```bash
printf "\033[1;1H" # move to top-left
printf "\033[0J" # clear screen
printf "\033[2;3H"
printf "A"
```

```

### CUP V-2: Off the Screen

```bash
printf "\033[1;1H" # move to top-left
printf "\033[0J" # clear screen
printf "\033[500;500H"
printf "A"
```

```

### CUP V-3: Relative to Origin

```bash
printf "\033[1;1H" # move to top-left
printf "\033[0J" # clear screen
printf "\033[2;3r" # scroll region top/bottom
printf "\033[?6h" # origin mode
printf "\033[1;1H" # move to top-left
printf "X"
```

```

|X_________|
```

### CUP V-4: Relative to Origin with Left/Right Margins

```bash
printf "\033[1;1H" # move to top-left
printf "\033[0J" # clear screen
printf "\033[?69h" # enable left/right margins
printf "\033[3;5s" # scroll region left/right
printf "\033[2;3r" # scroll region top/bottom
printf "\033[?6h" # origin mode
printf "\033[1;1H" # move to top-left
printf "X"
```

```

### CUP V-5: Limits with Scroll Region and Origin Mode

```bash
printf "\033[1;1H" # move to top-left
printf "\033[0J" # clear screen
printf "\033[?69h" # enable left/right margins
printf "\033[3;5s" # scroll region left/right
printf "\033[2;3r" # scroll region top/bottom
printf "\033[?6h" # origin mode
printf "\033[500;500H" # move to top-left
printf "X"
```

```

### CUP V-6: Pending Wrap is Unset

```bash
cols=$(tput cols)
printf "\033[${cols}G" # move to last column
printf "A" # set pending wrap state
printf "\033[1;1H"
printf "X"
```

```
