title: Vertical Position Absolute (VPA)
description: Move the cursor to a specific row.
---

<VTSequence sequence={["CSI", "Py", "d"]} />

This sequence performs [cursor position (CUP)](/docs/vt/csi/cup) with `y` set
to the parameterized value and `x` set to the current cursor position.
There is no additional or different behavior for using `VPA`.

Because this invokes `CUP`, the cursor column (`y`) can change if it is
outside the bounds of the `CUP` operation. For example, if
[origin mode](#TODO) is set and the current cursor position is outside
of the scroll region, the column will be adjusted.
