description: Move the cursor down `n` cells and to the beginning of the line.

<VTSequence sequence={["CSI", "Pn", "E"]} />

The parameter `n` must be an integer greater than or equal to 1.
If `n` is less than or equal to 0, adjust `n` to be 1. If `n` is
omitted, `n` defaults to 1.

The logic of this sequence is identical to
[Cursor Down (CUD)](/docs/vt/csi/cud)
followed by [Carriage Return (CR)](/docs/vt/control/cr).
