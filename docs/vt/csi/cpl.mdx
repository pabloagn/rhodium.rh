<VTSequence sequence={["CSI", "Pn", "F"]} />

The parameter `n` must be an integer greater than or equal to 1. If `n` is less than
or equal to 0, adjust `n` to be 1. If `n` is omitted, `n` defaults to 1.

The logic of this sequence is identical to [Cursor Up (CUU)](/docs/vt/csi/cuu)
followed by [Carriage Return (CR)](/docs/vt/control/cr).
