title: Cursor Forward (CUF)
description: Move the cursor `n` cells right.
---

<VTSequence sequence={["CSI", "Pn", "C"]} />

The parameter `n` must be an integer greater than or equal to 1. If `n` is less than
or equal to 0, adjust `n` to be 1. If `n` is omitted, `n` defaults to 1.

This sequence always unsets the pending wrap state.

The rightmost boundary the cursor can move to is determined by the current
cursor column and the [right margin](#TODO). If the cursor begins to the right
of the right margin, modify the right margin to be the rightmost column
of the screen for the duration of the sequence. The rightmost column the cursor
can be on is the right margin.

Move the cursor `n` cells to the right up to and including the rightmost boundary.
This sequence never wraps or modifies cell content. This sequence is not affected
by any terminal modes.

## Validation

### CUF V-1: Pending Wrap is Unset

```bash
cols=$(tput cols)
printf "\033[${cols}G" # move to last column
printf "A" # set pending wrap state
printf "\033[C" # move forward one
printf "XYZ"
```

```
|_________X|
|YZ________|
```

### CUF V-2: Rightmost Boundary with Reverse Wrap Disabled

```bash
printf "A"
printf "\033[500C" # forward larger than screen width
printf "B"
```

```
|A________Bc
```

### CUF V-3: Left of the Right Margin

```bash
printf "\033[1;1H" # move to top-left
printf "\033[0J" # clear screen
printf "\033[?69h" # enable left/right margins
printf "\033[3;5s" # scroll region left/right
printf "\033[1G" # move to left
printf "\033[500C" # forward larger than screen width
printf "X"
```

```
|____X_____|
```

### CUF V-4: Right of the Right Margin

```bash
printf "\033[1;1H" # move to top-left
printf "\033[0J" # clear screen
printf "\033[?69h" # enable left/right margins
printf "\033[3;5s" # scroll region left/right
printf "\033[6G" # move to right of margin
printf "\033[500C" # forward larger than screen width
printf "X"
```

```
|_________X|
```
