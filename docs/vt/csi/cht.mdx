title: Cursor Horizontal Tabulation (CHT)
description: Move the cursor right `n` tabs.
---

<VTSequence sequence={["CSI", "Pn", "I"]} />

The parameter `n` must be an integer greater than or equal to 1. If `n` is less than
or equal to 0, adjust `n` to be 1. If `n` is omitted, `n` defaults to 1.

The rightmost valid column for this operation is the rightmost column in
the terminal screen or the [right margin](#TODO), whichever is smaller.
This sequence does not change behavior with [origin mode](#TODO) set.

Move the cursor right until the cursor position is on a tabstop. If the
cursor would move past the rightmost valid column, the cursor remains at
the rightmost valid column and the operation completes. Repeat this process
`n` times.

Tabstops are dynamic and can be set with escape sequences such as
[horizontal tab set (HTS)](/docs/vt/csi/hts), [tab clear (TBC)](/docs/vt/csi/tbc), etc.
A terminal emulator may default tabstops at any interval, though an interval
of 8 spaces is most common.

## Validation

### CHT V-1: Right Beyond Last Column

```bash
printf "\033[?5W" # reset tab stops
printf "\033[100I" # assuming the test terminal has less than 800 columns
printf "A"
```

```
|_________A|
```

### CHT V-2: Right From Before a Tabstop

```bash
printf "\033[?5W" # reset tab stops
printf "\033[1;2H"
printf "A"
printf "\033[I"
printf "X"
```

```
|_A______X_|
```

### CHT V-3: Right Margin

```bash
printf "\033[1;1H" # move to top-left
printf "\033[0J" # clear screen
printf "\033[?5W" # reset tab stops
printf "\033[?69h" # enable left/right margins
printf "\033[3;6s" # scroll region left/right
printf "\033[1;1H" # move cursor in region
printf "X"
printf "\033[I"
printf "A"
```

```
