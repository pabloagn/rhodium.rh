title: Horizontal Position Relative (HPR)
description: |-
  Move the cursor to a specific column relative to the current position.

<VTSequence sequence={["CSI", "Px", "a"]} />

This sequence performs [cursor position (CUP)](/docs/vt/csi/cup) with `x` set
to the current cursor column plus `x` and `y` set to the current cursor row.
There is no additional or different behavior for using `HPR`.

The parameter `x` must be an integer greater than or equal to 1. If `x` is less than
or equal to 0, adjust `x` to be 1. If `x` is omitted, `x` defaults to 1.

Because this invokes `CUP`, the cursor row (`y`) can change if it is
outside the bounds of the `CUP` operation. For example, if
[origin mode](#TODO) is set and the current cursor position is outside
of the scroll region, the row will be adjusted.
