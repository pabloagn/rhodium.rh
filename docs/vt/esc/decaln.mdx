title: Screen Alignment Test (DECALN)
description: |-
  Reset margins, move cursor to the top left, and fill the screen with `E`.
---

<VTSequence sequence={["ESC", "#", "8"]} />

Reset the top, bottom, left, and right margins and unset [origin mode](#TODO).
The cursor is moved to the top-left corner of the screen.

All stylistic SGR attributes are unset, such as bold, blink, etc.
SGR foreground and background colors are preserved.
The [protected attribute](#TODO) is not unset.

The entire screen is filled with the character `E`. The letter `E` ignores
the current SGR settings and is written with no styling.

## Validation
