title: Save Cursor (DECSC)
description: |-
  Save various cursor-related state that can be restored with
  Restore Cursor (DECRC).
---

<VTSequence sequence={["ESC", "7"]} />

The following attributes are saved:

- Cursor row and column in absolute screen coordinates
- Character sets
- Pending wrap state
- SGR attributes
- [Origin mode (DEC Mode 6)](/vt/modes/origin)

Only one cursor can be saved at any time. If save cursor is repeated, the
previously save cursor is overwritten.

Primary and alternate screens have separate saved cursor state. A cursor
saved on the primary screen is inaccessible from the alternate screen
and vice versa.

## Validation

### SC V-1: Cursor Position

```bash
printf "\033[1;1H" # move to top-left
printf "\033[0J" # clear screen
printf "\033[1;5H"
printf "A"
printf "\0337" # Save Cursor
printf "\033[1;1H"
printf "B"
printf "\0338" # Restore Cursor
printf "X"
```

```
|B___AX____|
```

### SC V-2: Pending Wrap State

```bash
cols=$(tput cols)
printf "\033[1;1H" # move to top-left
printf "\033[0J" # clear screen
printf "\033[${cols}G"
printf "A"
printf "\0337" # Save Cursor
printf "\033[1;1H"
printf "B"
printf "\0338" # Restore Cursor
printf "X"
```

```
|B________A|
|X_________|
```

### SC V-3: SGR Attributes

```bash
printf "\033[1;1H" # move to top-left
printf "\033[0J" # clear screen
printf "\033[1;4;33;44m"
printf "A"
printf "\0337" # Save Cursor
printf "\033[0m"
printf "B"
printf "\0338" # Restore Cursor
printf "X"
```

```
|AX________|
```

The "A" and "X" should have identical styling.
