  APIs for developers writing applications that run in Ghostty.

Programs running in terminals use **control sequences** to interact with the
terminal. Control sequences are a series of special characters that the terminal
interprets as commands. This is sometimes referred as **VT sequences** or
**escape codes**.

For a full list of supported sequences, see the
[reference](/docs/vt/reference). For a conceptual overview
of control sequences, see the [concepts page](/docs/vt/concepts/sequences).
The current page will give an overview of Ghostty's control
sequence support.
